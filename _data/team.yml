    I'm a Lecturer at the <a href="https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/psychology/">Department of Psychology at Royal Holloway, University of London</a>. 
    I am interested in computational modelling (particularly Bayesian models), psychopharmacology, and psychometrics. I have experience working in the fields of psychosis and Corpus Callosum Dysgenesis.
    
    Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://qbi.uq.edu.au/">Queensland Brain Institute</a>, where I was part of the <a href="https://sites.wustl.edu/richardslab/" >Brain Development and Disorders Lab</a>, working with <a href="https://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/95844/60427"> Professor Peter Dayan </a> and <a href="https://neuroscience.wustl.edu/people/linda-richards-phd/"> Professor Linda Richards</a>. 
    I completed my PhD at the <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn">Institute of Psychiatry, Psycholgoy, and Neuroscience</a> at <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk">King's College London</a>. 
    
    During my PhD, I worked on paranoia and social dynamics, using a range of methods, including computational modelling, game theory, and psychopharmacology.
    
    My PhD supervisors were <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/mitul-mehta">Professor Mitul Mehta</a>, <a href="https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=VBELL56">Assoc. Prof Vaughan Bell</a>, and <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/quinton-deeley"><Prof Quinton Deeley</a>.
    
    I have previously completed an MSc in Clinical Mental Health and a BSc in Psychology and Neuroscience.
