 <h2>Research Assistant (RA)</h2>
  <p>I currently have no funding for RAs, and do not believe that it is equitable to offer research assistantships that are unfunded or honorary, because I believe this contributes to some of the inequalities in academia. I am, however, always keen to listen to ideas for obtaining funding for RAs, and it might be worth noting schemes such as the <a href="https://www.bap.org.uk/internship.php">BAP summer research internship scheme.</a></p>
	<h2>PhD</h2>
  <p>I am currently looking for PhD students to start in Autumn 2023! If you are interested in doing your PhD in the lab, please <a href="mailto:joseph.barnby@rhul.ac.uk">email me</a>. In particular, I'm looking for students who are a) enthusiastic about developing new theories of cognition and social interaction, and b) want to understand how these can be used to understand mental health (Note: coding experience is desired!). </p>
  <h4>PhD funding</h4> 
  <p>To embark on a PhD most students need external funding (and, indeed, I would always recommend obtaining some). I have no funded positions at the moment, but there are plenty of options listed on the <a href="https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/studying-here/fees-and-funding/research-degrees/sources-of-funding/">RHUL Psychology Department funding webpage.</a> I'm always happy to talk through funding options with potential students.</p>
  <p>There are also some excellent funded PhD routes through the <a href="https://www.lido-dtp.ac.uk/">LIDO Initiative.</a>, <a href="https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/psychology/studying-here/research-degrees/senss-esrc-doctoral-training/">SeNNS Initiative</a>, and the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/bbsrc-doctoral-training-partnership/">BBSRC DTP</a>
  <li><br>First, it would be great if you could send me some details of your interests and your research experience. This doesn’t need to be a formal CV, but can be a list of experiences and the corresponding skills you’ve learnt. This might include any research projects you’ve done, the courses you took as an undergraduate/MSc student, and any work experience you have. I recognise that not every undergraduate course offers research experience - so if that’s the case, please just say so, and highlight experiences you have had that use similar skills (such as report-writing, coding, teamwork, time management, data management). </li>
  <li><br>If there’s a good fit between our interests, we have a zoom meeting and discuss potential project options.</li>
  <li><br>If we decide to proceed, we together identify a second supervisor (as I am a new member of staff, all my PhD students will have a second supervisor who is more experienced).</li>
  <li>You prepare a draft research proposal (by the end of November).</li>
  <li>We work together to refine the proposal, normally by early-mid December.</li>
  <li>Depending on which funding stream you are applying for, you complete the relevant online forms by the deadline, which is typically in January. I can also talk the options through with you on zoom. 
  <br>
  If you have any questions about this process please do reach out. 



  <h2>Postdoc</h2>
  <p>I currently have no funding for postdocs. I would be very happy to support an application for a postdoc to be part of the lab - please <a href="mailto:joseph.barnby@rhul.ac.uk">email me</a>! </p>
